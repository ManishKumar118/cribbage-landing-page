                                            of
                                            attorney pursuant to the California Probate Code.

                                            <i>Excessive Requests:</i> If requests from a User are manifestly unfounded
                                            or
                                            excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may
                                            either
                                            (1) charge a reasonable fee, or (2) refuse to act on the request
                                            and notify the User of the reason for refusing the request. If we charge a
                                            fee,
                                            the amount will be based upon the administrative costs of providing the
                                            information or communication or taking the action requested.
